@article{Guinard2009,
	Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have promising industrial applications, since they reduce the gap between traditional enterprise systems and the real world. However, every particular application requires complex integration work, and therefore technical expertise, effort and time which prevents users from creating small tactical, ad-hoc applications using sensor networks. Following the success of Web 2.0 mashups , we propose a similar lightweight approach for combining enterprise services (e.g. ERPs) with WSNs. Specifically, we discuss the traditional integration solutions, propose and implement an alternative architecture where sensor nodes are accessible according to the REST principles. With this approach, the nodes become part of a Web of Things and interacting with them as well as composing their services with existing ones, becomes almost as easy as browsing the Web.},
