\section{Conclusions}

We have introduced iFLUX, a middleware that enables a lightweight integration of loosely coupled services. Developed in the context of Smart Cities, it is applicable to other domains. iFLUX is particularly well suited to facilitate prototyping and co-design activities in WoT environments. Hopefully, the examples have shown that bringing an existing component (a smart object, a WoT gateway or a software application) into the iFLUX ecosystem is quick and easy. Even if iFLUX is currently based on stateless Event-Condition-Action rules, we have evidence that valuable workflows can already be implemented from the system. Still, we are currently extending the programming model to support stateful rules. This raises new types of issues, in terms of scalability and performance. Last but not least, iFLUX is an open source project. More information is available at \url{www.iflux.io}.
